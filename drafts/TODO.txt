IN PROGRESS:

Show all projects on page load

  Remove getProjectAddress() function



TODO: 

From "miscellaneous printout -- choose size of struct elements to stack and save space"

  Incorporate Timothy GUI upgrades

  Make sure using withdrawl pattern

  Error checking/security  - i.e. malformed / invalid inputs
    Requesting refund or payout when balance is 0
   
  Design patterns: use require()
  Test revert()  -- Note: reverts will cause tests to fail  (maybe need to catch the errors??)
  


BACKLOG:

  Verify amounts of payouts, refunds, contributions, etc (minus gas cost) 


  Check account balances for required funds at the beginning of each test

  Show owner in project table

  Add basic error messages (for debug)
    When sending funds fails
    When transaction fails for another reason

  Split tests - Project.js, FundHub.js
