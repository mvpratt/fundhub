===============================================


BACKLOG:
  Increase duration of project in automated test.  Advance testrpc time to reach deadline
  Cleanup javascript console logging
  Loads really slow in Safari, console won't open
  Show owner in project table

  User wallet??
  Mist/Metamask/

  Update to truffle 3.2.1?  -- required for play_time example.

  Fix or remove broken tests  (only refund test required for b9lab)

  Debug - Reset FundingHub/Projects
  Create new test cases in which additional projects are deployed from FundingHub

  Error checking/security  - i.e. weird / malformed /invalid inputs
    Requesting funds when balance is 0
    Users cant get refund out of a funded project
    Does contract need some overhead funds?  make sure doesnt run out of money
    Change to withdrawl model
    Owner cant fund own contract!

  Refactoring:
    Can choose order of tests?
    Storage considerations
    tests - use truffle "require" to get the contract ABI once at beginning

  Add basic error messages (for debug)
    When sending funds fails
    When transaction fails for another reason

  Automated tests:
    Test - Owner requests payout, not admin  (issue, owners balance decreases because of the request costs gas)
    Test - Check that requester received funds, more precisely (minus gas cost)
    Test - Cleanup debug / admin function calls
