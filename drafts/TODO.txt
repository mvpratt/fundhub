IN PROGRESS:



Automated tests:

  Project Creation:
  DONE - Project created, constructor loads default values

  Project Refunds:
  DONE - Refund request denied when deadline not reached yet
  DONE - Refund request from non-contributer denied
       - Refund request fullfilled when deadline reached and project not fully funded


  Project Payouts:
  DONE - Payout request fullfilled when fundraising goal reached
  DONE - Payout request denied when project not fully funded
       - Payout request from non-owner is denied -- WILL CAUSE REVERT()



TODO: 
Verify amounts of payouts, refunds, contributions, etc
Build GUI
Any other contract optimizations?  Remove - getProjectAddress() and getAmountContributed()
Test refactor to be reusable in web code?  Functions - get list of projects, get list of project contributers
  Update readme
  Bug - sometimes events dont fire
  Bug - Tests fail sometimes :(   run everything 10x
  fix deadline test--  play_time example.
  modularize project creation
  Test revert()  -- Note: reverts will caust truffle tests to fail  (maybe need to catch them??)



Create 3 projects

  Automated tests:
    Test - Owner requests payout, not admin  (issue, owners balance decreases because of the request costs gas)
    Test - Check that requester received funds, more precisely (minus gas cost)
    Test - Cleanup debug / admin function calls

  Error checking/security  - i.e. weird / malformed /invalid inputs
    Requesting funds when balance is 0
    Users cant get refund out of a funded project
    Does contract need some overhead funds?  make sure doesnt run out of money
    Change to withdrawl model
    Owner cant fund own contract!

  Create new test cases in which additional projects are deployed from FundingHub



// HOW TO: track a bunch of projects
//  And array (address -> index), store array size, project name?
//  A mapping (address -> owner)

// HOW TO: Call a function and send it ETH
//address.func.value(amount)(arg1, arg2, arg3)

=============================================


DONE:
  Use modifiers
  Remove states
  Test payout - succeess
  Bug - sometimes tests fail - especially the deadline test  (added returns for every promise.  FIXED)
  Get rid of getAmountRaised()
  Update to truffle 3.4.x


DONE:
    Update Readme
    Move broken tests to drafts (not in repo)
    Write automated test for refund()
    Tested - Refunds not allowed unless deadline is reached and project isn't fully funded.
    Test payouts to multiple owners (user specified)
    Test refunds from multiple contributers
    Add constant functions
    Multiple contributers (max 3)
    Web UI - Multiple contributers, Show contributed balances from each contributer
    Select projec to fund
    Added support for 3 projects
    Improve display of balance (units of ETH)
    Use a struct to store info in Project
    Basic testing with geth local chain
    Add deadline to project
    Moved key project data to a struct
    Web UI - create new project from fundhub 
    Fund project from FundingHub (flow through)
    Create README.md
    Web UI - Create a new project from the Web Interface
    Web UI - Request Refund
    Web UI - Request Payout
    Web UI - Refresh automatically
    Allow multiple contributions from same person
    FundingHub can deploy a contract
    Add web interface - Project - show balance, state, and button to add funds
    Add events - basic
    Add modifiers - basic
    Users can get refunds from underfunded project that reached deadline
    If deadline expired, funds returned to contributer
    If deadline expired, payout disabled.
    If project is already fully funded, funds returned to contributer
    Run more than one test in same directory 
    Add access restrictions
    More than one contributer can add funds and request refund
    Payout enabled only when funding goal reached
    Record contributer address when funds received
    Payout to owner - called manually
    Allow contributer to request refund
    Create a project that allows a contributer to add money.

===============================================

BACKLOG:
  Check account balances for required funds at the beginning of each test
  Cleanup javascript console logging
  Loads really slow in Safari, console won't open
  Show owner in project table

  User wallet??
  Mist/Metamask/

  Debug - Reset FundingHub/Projects

  Add basic error messages (for debug)
    When sending funds fails
    When transaction fails for another reason
