IN PROGRESS:

  Bug -- Show all projects on page load



TODO: 

From "miscellaneous printout -- choose size of struct elements to stack and save space"

  Incorporate Timothy GUI upgrades

  Make sure using withdrawl pattern

  Error checking/security  - i.e. malformed / invalid inputs
    Requesting refund or payout when balance is 0
   
  Design patterns: use require()
  Test revert()  -- Note: reverts will cause tests to fail  (maybe need to catch the errors??)
  


BACKLOG:

  Verify amounts of payouts, refunds, contributions, etc (minus gas cost) 


  Check account balances for required funds at the beginning of each test

  Show owner in project table

  Add basic error messages (for debug)
    When sending funds fails
    When transaction fails for another reason

  Split tests - Project.js, FundHub.js


=============================================

DONE:
  Remove getProjectAddress() function
  Truffle migration script that creates a project after FundingHub deployed
  contribute() should use project address, not index
  Dont save duration in the contract
  modularize project creation
  Use modifiers
  Remove states
  Test payout - succeess
  Bug - sometimes tests fail - especially the deadline test  (added returns for every promise.  FIXED)
  Get rid of getAmountRaised()
  Update to truffle 3.4.x

    Update Readme
    Move broken tests to drafts (not in repo)
    Write automated test for refund()

    Run more than one test in same directory 
    Add access restrictions
