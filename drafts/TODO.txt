TODO:
  Issue - Trouble getting FundingHub to deploy a project from the browser (VM error: out of gas)

FundingHub:
  Owner requests payout, not admin  (issue, owners balance decreases because of the request costs gas)
  Tests - Check that requester received funds, more precisely (minus gas cost)
  Tests - Cleanup debug / admin function calls

Add state PAID_OUT

Web UI:
  Show contributed balances from each contributer

Testing:
  Run with geth local blockchain
  Improve display of balance

Feature:
  Add deadline support
  Test broken - deadline.js

===============================================

Low priority:
  If contribution puts over the top, extra funds returned to contributer
  Error checking/security  - i.e. weird / malformed /invalid inputs
    Requesting funds when balance is 0
    Users cant get refund out of a funded project
    Does contract need some overhead funds?  make sure doesnt run out of money
    Change to withdrawl model
    Owner cant fund own contract!
  Refactoring:
    Can choose order of tests?
    Storage considerations
    tests - use truffle "require" to get the contract ABI once at beginning
  Add basic error messages (for debug)
    When sending funds fails
    When transaction fails for another reason

=============================================
