IN PROGRESS:


GUI - refund  (advance time past deadline, request refund)




TODO: 

Make owner default to creator, or remove owner?
Remove getProjectAddress() function

Automated tests - Nothing with deadlines will work right now.  See play-with-time project from b9lab
  option - Turn on 1 second delay for blocks
  testrpc -b 1

  Make sure using withdrawl pattern

  Error checking/security  - i.e. malformed / invalid inputs
    Requesting refund or payout when balance is 0
    Can owner fund own contract?
   
  Verify amounts of payouts, refunds, contributions, etc (minus gas cost) 
  
  Functions - get list of projects, get list of project contributers.   
  Design patterns: use require()
  Test revert()  -- Note: reverts will caust truffle tests to fail  (maybe need to catch them??)
  

BACKLOG:

  Check account balances for required funds at the beginning of each test
  Cleanup javascript console logging
  Loads really slow in Safari, console won't open
  Show owner in project table


  Debug - Reset FundingHub/Projects
    Show events

  Add basic error messages (for debug)
    When sending funds fails
    When transaction fails for another reason

  Split tests - Project.js, FundHub.js



// HOW TO: track a bunch of projects
//  An array (address -> index), store array size, project name?
//  A mapping (address -> owner)

// HOW TO: Call a function and send it ETH
// address.func.value(amount)(arg1, arg2, arg3)
