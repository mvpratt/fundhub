TODO - User stories:
Add basic error messages (for debug)
  When sending funds fails
  When transaction fails for another reason

Add FundingHub:
  Set key parameters in constructor
  Owner requests payout, not admin  (issue, owners balance decreases because of the request costs gas)
  Add web interface 

Improve display of balance
Owner cant fund own contract!

Low priority features:
  Handle multiple contributions from same person -- allowed
  If contribution puts over the top, extra funds returned to contributer
  Error checking/security  - i.e. weird / malformed /invalid inputs
    Requesting funds when balance is 0
    Users cant get refund out of a funded project
    Does contract need some overhead funds?  make sure doesnt run out of money
    Change to withdrawl model
  Refactoring:
    Can choose order of tests?
    Storage considerations
    tests - use truffle "require" to get the contract ABI once at beginning

Testing:
  Run with geth local blockchain
