  Issue - Trouble getting FundingHub to deploy a project from the browser (VM error: out of gas)


FundingHub:
  Owner requests payout, not admin  (issue, owners balance decreases because of the request costs gas)
  Tests - Check that requester received funds, more precisely (minus gas cost)
  Tests - Cleanup debug / admin function calls


Web UI:
  Request Refund
  Request Payout
  Show contributed balances

Testing:
  Run with geth local blockchain
  Improve display of balance

Feature:
  Add deadline support
  Test broken - deadline.js

===============================================

Low priority:
  If contribution puts over the top, extra funds returned to contributer
  Error checking/security  - i.e. weird / malformed /invalid inputs
    Requesting funds when balance is 0
    Users cant get refund out of a funded project
    Does contract need some overhead funds?  make sure doesnt run out of money
    Change to withdrawl model
    Owner cant fund own contract!
  Refactoring:
    Can choose order of tests?
    Storage considerations
    tests - use truffle "require" to get the contract ABI once at beginning
  Add basic error messages (for debug)
    When sending funds fails
    When transaction fails for another reason

=============================================

DONE:
Web UI - Refresh automatically
Allow multiple contributions from same person
FundingHub can deploy a contract
Add web interface - Project - show balance, state, and button to add funds
Add events - basic
Add modifiers - basic
Users can get refunds from underfunded project that reached deadline
If deadline expired, funds returned to contributer
If deadline expired, payout disabled.
If project is already fully funded, funds returned to contributer
Run more than one test in same directory 
Add access restrictions
More than one contributer can add funds and request refund
Payout enabled only when funding goal reached
Record contributer address when funds received
Payout to owner - called manually
Allow contributer to request refund
Create a project that allows a contributer to add money.
